# 2019_XTERN_XPRESS

The best location would be found using the pseudo code that I have in the python file. As explained there, I am just now learning python and still have the rest of the semester and then another course next semester. I am also taking a Data Anaylsis class next Spring as well. 

I have no knowledge of any data visualization tools minus graphs. So i created a graph showing the locations of the scooters.

So my strategy for operations would be to start in the at the highest Y cordinate and work clockwise around the city from x = 0 to higest x. Then work way along the x axis back to MAX Y. From there go counter_clockwise around the city till the MIN X. From there go South to the MIN Y then back towards the X axis. From there drice back up through the X axis, and back to 20,19

I know this isn't a lot, and I don't blame you for not selecting me. I haven't learned anything yet on how to manipulate the data that I need. I know basic Python, Excel and how to sparingly use Github. So it isn't much, but I am willing to learn! Also if I don't get this, PLEASE tell me what I need to learn in order to become a better DS.
